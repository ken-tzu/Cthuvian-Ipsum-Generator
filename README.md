Cthuvian Ipsum Generator
A lorem ipsun generator based on [H.P. Lovecraft's](https://www.hplovecraft.com/) [Cthulhu Mythos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos)

## History
Way back in 2010, I wanted to try out this PHP thing, and ended up doing a [page](https://ephemer.kapsi.fi/FhtagnGenerator.php) for generating lorem ipsum placeholder text in Cthuvian (also called R'lyehian), the fictional language from H.P. Lovecraft's writings.

I used some resources which seem to no longer exist on the internet:
+ PHP Lorem Ipsum generator by Mathew Tinsley, originally found at [http://tinsology.net/scripts/php-lorem-ipsum-generator/](http://tinsology.net/scripts/php-lorem-ipsum-generator/)
+ Improved wordlist (with prefixes and suffixes) from Cthuvian / English dictionary, originally found at [http://www.yog-sothoth.com/threads/8683-The-Complete-CTHUVIAN-ENGLISH-DICTIONARY](http://www.yog-sothoth.com/threads/8683-The-Complete-CTHUVIAN-ENGLISH-DICTIONARY)

The code is put here "as was" for historical accuracy and is outdated and horrible in many ways, but hey, it still works, as seen on the [original page](https://ephemer.kapsi.fi/FhtagnGenerator.php). Maybe I'll make a modern version of it. Probably I won't.
